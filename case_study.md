 ## “Predicting the Next Box Office Hit: A Data-Driven Approach to Movie Success”  
 In this project, I built an end-to-end automated ETL pipeline that pulls daily updates from Kaggle’s TMDB movie dataset into PostgreSQL, performs staging and normalization, and connects directly to Power BI for real-time analytics.
 Using over 1 million records, the goal was to uncover what factors drive movie success — helping producers, marketers, and movie fans understand the elements that lead to high revenue, ratings, and popularity.

### Analytical Questions Explored:
- What genres consistently generate the highest revenue?
- Do higher budgets correlate with better ratings or box office returns?
- Which production companies produce the most profitable movies?
- Has the popularity of certain genres increased over time?
- Can we forecast what genre is likely to dominate in the next 5 years?
- Do movies with higher IMDB votes match TMDB's popularity score?
- Is there a 'sweet spot' runtime for successful movies?

### Tech Stack:
- Python: Automated data extraction & transformation
- PostgreSQL: Normalized data storage & relational modeling
- Power BI: Interactive visual analytics
- Windows Task Scheduler: ETL automation
